EvvGC - Open Source 3 axis gimbal controller (hardware files)
======================

20130711 - initial creation and population of files

20130712 - updated vpre1.3ce2 with Digikey BOM, and a few part substitutions, no layout changes

20130712 - SandSquid link to the vpre1.3ce2 BOM - ~~http://www.sandsquid.com/#2FwTDG~~

20130714 - Updated vpre1.3ce2 componets R5, R13, R14 from 1k resistors to 10k to better match the STM spec

20130715 - No changes, just a quick sync of the 1.3ce2 documents and the OSH/Stencil file

20130802 - vpre1.3ce2 - SandSquid updated to include female housing/pins - ~~http://www.sandsquid.com/#b4xPP5~~

20130820 - vpre1.3ce2 - until further notice the online BOM on sandsquid isn't working... I'm working with the company to fix it
           they have some issues on their side

20130822 - vpre1.3ce2 - updated actual altium documents to reflect the resistor change on the green diodes.  Combined it with other 
           330ohm resistors so you'd only have to order more of the same as opposed a new line item.
         - updated the sandsquid BOM - link is http://www.sandsquid.com/#wL1Nhu
